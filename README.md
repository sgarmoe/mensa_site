Personal project working with:
    -JavaScript
    -Next.JS
    -React
    -HTML 
    -CSS
    -MongoDB
    
MongoDB is used to store all NFL player history and Sleeper API to match with current player data.

Website displays records for an ongoing fantasy football website for which I am the commisioner. 

Features include (or will include) a home page, rosters, weekly matchups, all-time statistics, etc. 

All critiques or compliments are welcome, as the main goal is to improve my development skills.
