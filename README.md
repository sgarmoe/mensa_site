Personal project aiming to develop skills in JS, HTML, and CSS. Site also uses MongoDB to store all NFL player history and Sleeper API to access current player data.
Website displays records for an ongoing fantasy football website for which I am the commisioner. 
Features include (or will include) a home page, rosters, weekly matchups, all-time statistics, etc. 

All critiques or compliments are welcome, as the main goal is to improve my development skills.
